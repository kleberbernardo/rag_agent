"""Extensions and the Portuguese text search configuration.

What this project owns in the database. The tables belong to
langchain-postgres, which creates them on first write, and the two search
indexes are built after that because they cannot exist before the table does.

Postgres ships a `portuguese` configuration that stems but does not fold
accents, so "suspensão" stems to `suspensã` while "suspensao" stems to
`suspensa`, and a question written without the accent finds nothing. Measured
against a running database, that is the difference between the keyword half of
the search working and not working at all.
