"""Alembic's entry point, pointed at this project's settings.

The URL is not written in alembic.ini. It comes from `DATABASE_URL` through the
same settings object the application reads, so there is one place that knows
where the database is and no way for the two to disagree.

There is no `target_metadata` and no autogenerate. The tables belong to
langchain-postgres, which creates them itself; what this project owns is the
extensions and the text search configuration, and those are written by hand
because autogenerate cannot see them.
