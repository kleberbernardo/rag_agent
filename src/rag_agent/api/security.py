"""API authentication.

A service that spends money per request cannot be open to whoever reaches the
port. One shared key in a header is the smallest thing that closes that, and
it is enough for a service behind a gateway or inside a private network.

It is deliberately not an identity system. There are no users, no scopes and
no rotation: anything beyond a single shared secret belongs to whatever issues
the tokens, not here.
