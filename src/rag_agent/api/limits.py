"""Rate limiting: a ceiling per caller, so one client cannot spend the budget.

Without this, a client in a retry loop asks a thousand questions a minute and
every one of them is a paid call to a model provider. The first sign is the
invoice.

The limit is per caller, not per process. A caller is its API key when there is
one and its address when there is not, because a service behind a shared key
still wants one client's loop to be one client's problem.

## Why not slowapi

slowapi is the usual answer for FastAPI and it does not work here. Both of its
middlewares find the route by walking `app.routes` looking for something with
an `.endpoint`, and current FastAPI wraps everything registered through
`include_router` in an `_IncludedRouter` that has none. Every request therefore
looks like a route it cannot identify, which it treats as exempt, and nothing
is ever limited. That failure is silent: the limiter reports itself enabled and
the ceiling never fires.

What is used instead is `limits`, the library slowapi is built on, and the same
one behind flask-limiter. It is the primitive rather than a smaller wrapper of
it, and the wrapper is what was broken.
