"""What people thought of an answer.

The evaluation dataset is written by whoever built the system, which means it
tests the questions that person thought of. Feedback from real use is the only
source of the ones they did not.

It goes to Langfuse as a score on the trace that produced the answer, which is
where the platform already keeps everything else about that run. A local JSON
lines file is written as well, so the loop still closes when tracing is off
and so the rejected answers can be read without an account.
