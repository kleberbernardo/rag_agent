"""Where the agent's instructions come from, and how they are rendered.

The text lives in `prompt_templates.py`. This module decides where to read it
from: Langfuse when tracing is configured, the templates otherwise. Publishing
the prompts turns them into versioned assets, so changing how the agent behaves
becomes a label move in a UI rather than a commit, a build and a deploy.

An unreachable Langfuse must never stop the agent from answering, so every
path here falls back to the shipped text.
