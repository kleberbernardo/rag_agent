"""A model grading what string matching cannot reach.

The deterministic metrics check numbers and file names. They pass an answer
that states the right figure while inverting the condition around it: the
regulation says a fact "may" be withheld, the answer says it "must" be, and no
number moved. Catching that needs something that reads.

The cost is what a judge always costs. It spends tokens on every case, and it
drifts, so the same answer can be graded differently twice. That is why it runs
only when asked for and never replaces the deterministic metrics: they say
whether the number is right, this says whether the sentence around it is.

The rubric is a managed prompt like any other, so tightening it is a version in
Langfuse rather than a commit.
