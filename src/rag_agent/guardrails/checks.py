"""The checks themselves, and the decision of what blocks and what only warns.

A question is refused before it costs anything. An answer has already been
paid for by the time it can be judged, so what happens to it is a finding
attached to the result, not an exception thrown at the caller.

The one exception to that is the token ceiling, which is about money rather
than quality: a run that blew past it is reported so the caller knows the
answer was expensive, but the answer is still returned, because throwing it
away would waste what was already spent.
