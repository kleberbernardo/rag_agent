"""Prompt injection, on the way in and on the way into the index.

Two doors, and the second is the one that belongs to RAG.

**The question.** Someone types an instruction instead of a question, trying
to talk past the system prompt.

**The corpus.** A retrieved passage is pasted into the context and the model
reads it exactly the way it reads the system prompt: a retriever works in
embedding space and has no notion of "this is data" rather than "this is an
instruction". A document carrying a hidden instruction therefore attacks every
question that retrieves it. OWASP calls this indirect prompt injection, and it
is the risk specific to retrieval rather than to chat.

Scanning the corpus happens **at ingestion**, once per chunk, and not at query
time. The documents are ours and they change when someone indexes them, so
paying per question for an answer that cannot change between questions would
be latency bought for nothing.

## Why not the classifier LLM Guard ships

Measured on this corpus, eight cases, four of them real attacks:

| Model | Correct | False positives | Open |
|---|---|---|---|
| `katanemolabs/Arch-Guard` | 7/8 | 0 | yes |
| `testsavantai/prompt-injection-defender-large-v0` | 6/8 | 0 | yes |
| `jackhhao/jailbreak-classifier` | 5/8 | 0 | yes |
| `protectai/deberta-v3-base-prompt-injection-v2` | 5/8 | **3** | yes |
| `meta-llama/Llama-Prompt-Guard-2-86M` | not tested | | **gated** |

The last row is the one the market would reach for first: Meta's Prompt Guard
2 is multilingual by design and evaluated on Portuguese. It is also a gated
repository, so using it means accepting a licence and carrying a Hugging Face
token, which is a reasonable thing for a company and a poor default for a
project someone clones.

The `protectai` model is what LLM Guard uses by default, and it refused all
three legitimate Portuguese questions at a confidence of 1.00. The same
question in English passed. It is trained on English, and no threshold
separates a language from an attack.
