"""Logging setup for console and file output.

Most of this file is about other people's libraries. The guardrail stack pulls
in transformers, presidio and structlog, and each of them logs at INFO or
WARNING about things that are normal here: a recogniser skipped for the wrong
language, a model being loaded, a progress bar for weights read from disk.
None of it is a problem, all of it reaches the terminal, and a screen of
warnings during a question teaches the reader to ignore warnings.

They are quietened for the console and left intact in the file, so the noise
is still there when someone actually needs it.
