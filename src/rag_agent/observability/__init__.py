"""Knowing what the agent did, what it cost, and writing it down.

Three concerns that share one question: after a run, what happened? Tracing
sends the timeline to Langfuse, pricing turns token counts into money, and
logging puts the same story on the console and in a file.

The Langfuse connection lives in `tracing` and serves three purposes at once,
which is why prompt fetching sits there too: the platform holds the prompt
registry on the same client that carries the traces, and opening a second
connection to keep the naming tidy would cost more than it explains.
