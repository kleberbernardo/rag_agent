"""Optional LLM tracing through Langfuse.

The local metrics in `types.RunMetrics` say what a run cost in total. A trace
says where it went: each model call, each tool, each retrieved passage, with
its own latency and token count.

Tracing is off unless both Langfuse keys are configured, and a broken or
unreachable Langfuse never breaks an answer -- observability that can take the
application down with it is worse than none.
