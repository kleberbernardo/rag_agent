"""Keyword search, answered by Postgres full text search.

An embedding compares meaning, which is what lets "quanto custa o plano mais
barato" find a passage that says neither word. It also spreads a long article's
signal across everything that article discusses, so one sentence stating a
deadline sits below whatever the article is mostly about.

Keyword search compares words. It cannot follow a paraphrase, and it does not
need to when the question names the terms the text uses: article numbers,
paragraph marks and deadlines have identity rather than meaning, and an
embedding blurs exactly those.

Postgres answers this against the same rows that hold the vectors, using a GIN
index. The alternative, a BM25 index built in the application's memory from
every stored chunk, is a copy that has to be rebuilt on every write and cannot
outgrow one process.
