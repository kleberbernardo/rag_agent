"""The Postgres connection and the schema the retrieval layer depends on.

Two things live here that the rest of the package assumes are already true:
the extensions, and the text search configuration used by keyword search.

Postgres ships a `portuguese` configuration that stems but does not fold
accents, so "suspensão" and "suspensao" stem to different words and a question
written without the accent finds nothing. Folding them is a matter of putting
`unaccent` ahead of the stemmer in a configuration of our own, which is the
standard recipe and the reason this module exists at all.
