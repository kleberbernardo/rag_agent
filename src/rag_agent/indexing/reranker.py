"""The second pass: reordering what the search already retrieved.

The retrievers underneath compare a question to a passage through something
precomputed. An embedding is calculated at ingestion, long before the question
exists, so it compresses the passage without knowing what will be asked of it.
Keyword search compares words, which have no opinion about each other.

A cross-encoder reads the question and the passage together, in one pass, and
answers the question directly: does this passage answer that one. That is why
it is more accurate, and why it cannot be precomputed and costs a model pass
per candidate.

The two stages have different jobs. Retrieval decides what is in the pool and
is judged on recall. Reranking decides what comes out of it and is judged on
precision. A reranker cannot repair a pool the answer is not in, which is
exactly why this is off by default here: the failure this corpus had was
recall, and hybrid search is what fixed it.
