"""Command line interface: presentation only, no domain logic.

One module per group of commands, and one Typer application assembled from
them here. It was a single 742-line module, which is what a file becomes when
every new command is appended to the end of the last one.

    rag ingest              build the index from data/
    rag sources             list what is indexed, or drop one document
    rag ask "question"      ask the agent once
    rag chat                talk to the agent with memory
    rag status              inspect the current configuration and index
    rag eval                grade the agent against known answers
    rag serve               start the HTTP API
    rag prompt show|push    read and publish the prompts
    rag dataset push        upload the evaluation dataset

The commands are registered rather than re-declared: each module owns a Typer
instance holding its own, and `add_typer` folds them into one application. A
new group is a new module and one line here.
